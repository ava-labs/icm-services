# External Interoperability

The goal of external interoperability is to provide solutions for sending messages to and from Avalanche and Avalanche L1s to other EVM chains like Ethereum. The resulting ecosystem should give application developers the tools necessary to build bridges of communications between themselves. The underlying protocols should be decentralized and permissionless. This document describes the architecture regarding messaging creation, delivery, and verification.
